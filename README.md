A curated list of Codewars katas for beginners.

These katas should mostly be within reach of people who have been learning the basics of javascript as their first programming language, (most, if not all, can be completed in other languages as well.) There are a few wildcards in there which will be more difficult.

I encourage you not to peek at the answers. If you get stuck, move on to the next kata. The answer will come to you in time, the more you immerse yourself in learning the skills needed to be a great programmer.

If you get to the end of the list just keep exploring Codewars. You can click the "Kata" button in the toolbar and browse other challenges. Also, keep an eye on this list for new katas. I have completed close to 1000 Codewars katas so I will try to keep adding to the list the ones I think are helpful for beginners. 

Don't give up!
