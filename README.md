# A curated list of Codewars katas for beginners.

## Getting Started
This might be stating the obvious, but make sure you have created a Codewars account and are logged in to Codewars before clicking on the links to the katas!

These katas should mostly be within reach of people who have been learning the basics of javascript as their first programming language, (most, if not all, can be completed in other languages as well.) There are a few wildcards in there which will be more difficult.

## About Codewars
### What is it and how does it work?
Codewars is a platform designed to help users become better programmers by learning programming concepts, specific programming language features and general problem solving skills through coding challenges.
You might notice that Codewars has a Japanese martial arts theme. Coding challenges are called "kata", user ranks start at "8kyu" and progress to "1kyu", then "1Dan" up to "8Dan". It is important to note that kata difficulty is indicated by rank also, (if you are a beginner programmer, you should start with 8kyu and 7kyu kata, not 1kyu and 2kyu!) The more kata you complete, the more rank you accrue. The more rank you accrue, the longer it takes to rank up more, especially if you only do easy kata.
### How do I do a kata?
You can click the links here in the KataIndex.md file to do the kata listed here. If you want to further explore Codewars kata, just click the search button in the left sidebar when signed in to Codewars. When you click on a kata you will be taken to a description page. Read the description carefully, then click the "Train" button in the top right corner. The challenge begins...
### Now what am I looking at?
You'll notice that you can see the description again, on the left side of the screen and you have two windows on the right that you can type things in (don't type anything in the bottom one at this point!)
In most kata you'll be expected to write a function. You write it in the upper text box on the right of the kata window. You don't need to call your function, the kata will call your function several times with different arguments. The kata "knows" what arguments it passed your function and it "knows" the result it expects you to return for each set of arguments. You can run the example tests in the lower text box by pressing `TEST`. You can run the full suite of tests by pressing `ATTEMPT`. If all the tests pass when you press the `ATTEMPT` button, you have completed the kata and you should `SUBMIT` your solution to gain rank for completing it.

## Tips
I encourage you not to peek at the answers. If you get stuck, move on to the next kata. The answer will come to you in time, the more you immerse yourself in learning the skills needed to be a great programmer.

If you get to the end of the list just keep exploring Codewars. You can click the "Kata" button in the toolbar and browse other challenges. Also, keep an eye on this list for new katas. I have completed close to 1000 Codewars katas so I will try to keep adding to the list the ones I think are helpful for beginners.

Also, try not to rush through the list of katas. When you complete a kata, before looking at others' solutions, spend some time trying to see if there are other ways you could think about solving the problem. Try them out. Do they work? Then spend some time going through others' solutions. See if you can understand them. See if you can google what you don't understand. The more you understand from solving one kata the more tools you will have for solving others.

Don't give up!
